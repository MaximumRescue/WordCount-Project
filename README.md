## WordCount-Project
Hello, everyone. This repository just contains a simple project that gets the information of a file.  
I did it in **PYTHON** for the reason that I am familiar with it, and I am not sure whether some freshmen can make sense of my code.  
Well, you know it's just like constructing a building, some fundamental works are needed.  
If you are not good at English, you should have regretted why you did not pay much attention on your former course.  
And repeat it again: **NO COMMENT!!!**
